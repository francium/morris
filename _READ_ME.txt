This project was written in the Intellij Idea IDE.
While the program has been test and works on a windows machine,
compiling it on a *nix machine is much more straight forward
and we have included a executable script to do so for you.

For convenience, a pre-compiled executable jar is also included which
will work on any platform


-- MAC OS or Linux --
- Compile and run through command line using supplied scripts
$ sh make.sh
$ sh run.sh

- To run the pre-compiled jar file instead, do
$ jar -jar out/artifacts/morris_jar/morris.jar


-- Windows --
- To run the pre-compiled jar on windows, double click it from
the "out\artifacts\morris_jar" path
