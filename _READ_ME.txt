This project was written in the Intellij Idea IDE on a *nix machine.
While the program has been test and works on a windows machine,
compiling it on a *nix machine is much more straight forward
and we have included a executable script to do so for you.

For convenience, a precompiled execuatable jar is also included which
will work on any platform


-- MAC OS or Linux --
- Compile and run through command line using supplied scripts
$ ./make.sh     # if it doesn't work, try $ sh make.sh
$ ./run.sh      # if it doesn't work, try $ sh run.sh

- To run the precompiled jar file instead, do
$ jar -jar out/artifacts/morris_jar/morris.jar


-- Windows --
- To run the precompiled jar on windows, double click it from
the out\artifacts\morris_jar path
